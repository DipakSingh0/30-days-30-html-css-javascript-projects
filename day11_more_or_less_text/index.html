    <h1>More Or Less</h1>

    <p>
      Barnaby the tortoise, often teased by Penelope the rabbit for his slow
      pace, surprised everyone by challenging her to a race. Penelope, confident
      in her speed, accepted, but her overconfidence led her to take a nap
      during the race. Meanwhile, Barnaby, with unwavering determination,
      maintained a steady pace, ignoring the distractions and focusing on the
      finish line.

        Barnaby's victory echoed through Sunny Meadow, a tale whispered from
        dandelion to daisy. Penelope, initially mortified, surprised everyone by
        congratulating Barnaby, a genuine admiration replacing her previous
        mockery. She even asked him for training tips, though Barnaby's "method"
        mostly involved napping and meticulously polishing his shell. The Great
        Meadow Games arrived, and while Penelope, now humbled, won the speed
        dash, Barnaby, to everyone's astonishment, won the long-distance crawl.
        Heâ€™d paced himself perfectly, a tiny, determined engine chugging
        steadily towards the finish line while others faltered. The unlikely duo
        became friends, Penelope learning patience and Barnaby embracing a bit
        more pep in his step (though just a bit).
